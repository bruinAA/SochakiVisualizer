In order for the program to work you need to download the attached files, and matplotlib.
You also need to update the filepaths at the top of the file (lines 10 and 13) to match the location of the files you downloaded with the program.



Note, below here only applies if you elect to save your file:

Also note that right now when you save a file, unless you manually change the name in line 216, 251, 288, or 327, the file will save to the preset names.
Lastly, if you select to save a file, the program will take significantly more time than otherwise, but you will know your file has been successfully saved when the built in matplotlib player pops up on your screen,
in the same way that would have happened had you not elected to save your animation.
